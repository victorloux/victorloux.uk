## Build

CSS dependencies: Sass, Bourbon and Neat.

I used LiveReload. Call Jade/pug on `index.jade` and Sass on `css/main.sass`, all the other files are imported from these two.

To convert images (same principle as [css-responsive-images](https://github.com/victorloux/css-responsive-images)), call `fish projects/convert.fish` (if you don't use fish, it can be trivially converted to a bash script).
