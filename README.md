## Build

Run `npm install` then `gulp`.

To convert images (same principle as [css-responsive-images](https://github.com/victorloux/css-responsive-images)), call `fish projects/convert.fish` (if you don't use fish, it can be trivially converted to a bash script). [todo: convert as a Gulp task]

## Libraries

The CSS and boilerplate is based off [Skeleton](https://github.com/WhatsNewSaes/Skeleton-Sass/), [FastShell](https://hosseinkarami.com/fastshell/), and the [7-1 pattern](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate).
